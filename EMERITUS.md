# containerd Emeritus Maintainers

## John Howard [@lowenna](https://github.com/lowenna)

John's tremendous efforts to get containers working on Windows lead to cross-platform images
as they are known today. Due to his work, containerd has first class support for Windows and
contributed to it being the most cross-platform capable container runtime.

## Kenfe-Mickaël Laventure [@mlaventure](https://github.com/mlaventure)

One of the first contributors to containerd, Mickaël led the effort to get the first
versions of containerd used as the runtime for dockerd. He has made a significant impact on the
runtime codebase from the API to the OCI runtime.

## Abhinandan Prativadi [@abhi](https://github.com/abhi)

A significant contributor to the CRI plugin and container networking, Abhi helped make
containerd a reliable and complete container runtime for Kubernetes.

## Lantao Liu [@Random-Liu](https://github.com/Random-Liu)

Lantao Liu was one of the initial authors of the containerd CRI plugin.  Lantao
worked across the Kubelet, Kubernetes project infrastructure, CRI, and
containerd to enable containerd to be one of the first CRI-enabled runtimes for
Kubernetes.  containerd is now the default container runtime for several
Kubernetes providers, which would not have been possible without Lantao's
dedicated work.  While Lantao is no longer involved in the day-to-day
maintenance of the CRI plugin or containerd in general, he remains involved in
the larger Kubernetes community.
